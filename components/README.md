# Connected - Code description 
<i>Provided by GPT</i>

The import statements at the top of the file load various dependencies including the Chakra UI library, Solana wallet adapter, Metaplex SDK, and Next.js router.

The Connected component defines some state variables using the useState hook, including candyMachine, isMinting, images, and currentImage. It also defines some callback functions using the useCallback hook, including handleClick, handlePrevImage, and handleNextImage.

The useConnection and useWallet hooks are used to access the Solana connection and wallet adapter from the Solana wallet adapter React library. The useMemo hook is used to memoize the Metaplex object created by calling the Metaplex.make method with the connection and wallet adapter.

The useEffect hook is used to load the CandyMachineV2 object from the Metaplex SDK by calling the metaplex.candyMachinesV2().findByAddress method with the address of the Candy Machine V2.

The handleClick callback function is called when the user clicks a button to mint an NFT. It first checks that the user is connected to a wallet and that the Candy Machine V2 has been loaded. It then calls the metaplex.candyMachinesV2().mint method with the candyMachine object to mint the NFT. Finally, it navigates to a new route using the Next.js router.push method.

The component renders a Container from Chakra UI that takes up the full height of the viewport and contains a Box with a semi-transparent background that is centered on the page. Inside the Box, there is a VStack that contains a Heading, some Text, and an image gallery that displays the images array of images. The image gallery uses the Box, HStack, Image, ChevronLeftIcon, and ChevronRightIcon components from Chakra UI to display the images and arrows for navigating between them. The handlePrevImage and handleNextImage callback functions are used to change the currentImage state variable and update the displayed image. The component also renders a Button that the user can click to mint an NFT.
