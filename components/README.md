## Components

### <a href="https://github.com/ilovespectra/heliumdenver/blob/main/components/Disconnected.tsx" target="_blank">`Disconnected.tsx`</a>
This code defines a React functional component called "Disconnected", which renders a section of a web page that encourages the user to connect their Solana wallet in order to mint HACK tokens. Here is a breakdown of the code:

Import statements: The component imports several modules from external libraries such as React, Chakra UI, and Solana wallet adapter.
Function signature: The component is defined as a "FC" (function component) and does not take any props as input.
Hook calls: The component uses the "useWalletModal" and "useWallet" hooks from the Solana wallet adapter library to manage the wallet connection state.
handleClick function: This function is called when the user clicks the "Become a Hacker" button. It checks if a wallet is already connected and opens a modal to connect a wallet if one is not connected yet. The function is defined using the "useCallback" hook to prevent unnecessary re-renders of the component.
JSX: The component returns a JSX expression that renders a heading with a background box containing text encouraging the user to mint HACK tokens and learn new skills, as well as a button that triggers the "handleClick" function. The JSX also uses Chakra UI components to set styles for the heading, button, and box.

### <a href="https://github.com/ilovespectra/heliumdenver/blob/main/components/Connected.tsx" target="_blank">`Connected.tsx`</a>
The import statements at the top of the file load various dependencies including the Chakra UI library, Solana wallet adapter, Metaplex SDK, and Next.js router.

The Connected component defines some state variables using the useState hook, including candyMachine, isMinting, images, and currentImage. It also defines some callback functions using the useCallback hook, including handleClick, handlePrevImage, and handleNextImage.

The useConnection and useWallet hooks are used to access the Solana connection and wallet adapter from the Solana wallet adapter React library. The useMemo hook is used to memoize the Metaplex object created by calling the Metaplex.make method with the connection and wallet adapter.

The useEffect hook is used to load the CandyMachineV2 object from the Metaplex SDK by calling the metaplex.candyMachinesV2().findByAddress method with the address of the Candy Machine V2.

The handleClick callback function is called when the user clicks a button to mint an NFT. It first checks that the user is connected to a wallet and that the Candy Machine V2 has been loaded. It then calls the metaplex.candyMachinesV2().mint method with the candyMachine object to mint the NFT. Finally, it navigates to a new route using the Next.js router.push method.

The component renders a Container from Chakra UI that takes up the full height of the viewport and contains a Box with a semi-transparent background that is centered on the page. Inside the Box, there is a VStack that contains a Heading, some Text, and an image gallery that displays the images array of images. The image gallery uses the Box, HStack, Image, ChevronLeftIcon, and ChevronRightIcon components from Chakra UI to display the images and arrows for navigating between them. The handlePrevImage and handleNextImage callback functions are used to change the currentImage state variable and update the displayed image. The component also renders a Button that the user can click to mint an NFT.

### <a href="https://github.com/ilovespectra/heliumdenver/blob/main/components/WalletContextProvider.tsx" target="_blank">`WalletContextProvider.tsx`</a>
This code exports a functional component called WalletContextProvider, which provides a context for handling Solana wallets. It imports several components and libraries from the @solana and react namespaces, including the ConnectionProvider, WalletProvider, and WalletModalProvider components from the @solana/wallet-adapter-react and @solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui libraries. It also imports useMemo from the react library.

Within the WalletContextProvider function, a URL is defined using the clusterApiUrl method from the @solana/web3.js library. The component then creates instances of several wallet adapter objects, including PhantomWalletAdapter, SolflareWalletAdapter, TorusWalletAdapter, and CoinbaseWalletAdapter, using the new keyword. These wallet adapters are stored in an array called wallets using the useMemo hook.

The ConnectionProvider and WalletProvider components wrap around the WalletModalProvider component and the children of WalletContextProvider. The ConnectionProvider sets the Solana network endpoint for the provider, while WalletProvider specifies an array of wallet adapters that are provided to the child components via the React context. Finally, the WalletModalProvider provides a modal for connecting and disconnecting wallets that are connected to the application.

The component then returns the children wrapped in the ConnectionProvider, WalletProvider, and WalletModalProvider. The entire component is exported as the default export of the module.

### <a href="https://github.com/ilovespectra/heliumdenver/blob/main/components/NavBar.tsx" target="_blank">`NavBar.tsx`</a>
This code is defining a React functional component called NavBar which returns a HStack component from the Chakra UI library.

The HStack component is used to horizontally align the child components. The first child component is a Spacer component from the Chakra UI library, which fills up the space to the left of the second child component.

The second child component is a dynamically loaded WalletMultiButton component from the @solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui package. It is being loaded dynamically using the dynamic function from the next/dynamic package, which allows for dynamic imports of modules.

The WalletMultiButton component is a pre-built button provided by the @solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui package, which enables users to connect their wallet and interact with the Solana blockchain. It is being given a custom class name using the className prop, which is defined in the styles object imported from the Home.module.css file.
